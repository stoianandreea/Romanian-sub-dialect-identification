# Romanian-sub-dialect-identification
The project was a Kaggle competition. Participants had to build a model for a in-genre binary classification by dialect task, in which a classification model is required to discriminate between the Moldavian (MD) and the Romanian (RO) dialects.
I submitted 4 variants with accuracy on final results between 0.688 and 0.711. At the final results, I was on place 47 out of 190.
